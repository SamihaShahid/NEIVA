## Next Gen Emissions Inventory expansion of Akagi (NEIVA) version 1.1

### Welcome to NEIVA inventory!

NEIVA is a biomass burning emissions inventory. It consists of data files, design codes and tools. We provide a recommended emission factor dataset. The chemical compounds are mapped to model surrogates to faciliate model application. We also provide a platform to incorporate new data in future. The codes are compatible to incorporate new data and it requires minimum modification from a user.

## Getting Started

The main branch contains the most recent files. The NEIVA_UserGuide (located in- NEIVA_v_1.1/Docs/) has documented the overall database structure, codes and tools. The users are recommended to visit this document. A user will need some familiarity with python to use the codes and tools. At minimum, users are encouraged to be familair with Pandas, NumPy libraries, the bsic syntax of a function, loop and different variable classes such as lists, strings.

## Downloading NEIVA
