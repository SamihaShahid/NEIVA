## Next Gen Emissions Inventory expansion of Akagi (NEIVA) version 1.1

### Welcome to NEIVA inventory!

NEIVA is a biomass burning emissions inventory. It consists of data files, database design codes and tools. We recommend emission factor (EF) and provide relevant property data for atmospheric modeling. Moreover, the chemical compounds are mapped to model surrogates to facilitate model application. This database is reproducible.There are  programs for data integration and calculation. These programs can incorporate new data. Minimum human review is required in this process. 

## Downloading NEIVA

1) Download the zip file. Unzip the file and put it where you want. No additional set up is required. 
2) Python is required to use the codes and tools.

A user will need some familiarity with python to use the codes and tools. At minimum, users are encouraged to be familair with Pandas, NumPy libraries, the bsic syntax of a function, loop and different variable classes such as lists, strings.
